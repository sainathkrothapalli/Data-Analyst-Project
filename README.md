# Data-Analyst-Projects

Created end to end data analyst project from webscrapping amazon.com website to visualizing using tableau.
1. I scrapped the amazon website for "Shoe's for men" search keyword and stored the result in .csv file.
2. Using pandas I cleaned the data obatined from first step, by removing duplicate data, changing column types, creating new columns etc
   and stored new result in .csv file.
3. I connected new csv to MYSQL workbench, and I retrieved the data for multiples questions like best adidas products, Men's sneakers details etc.
4. Then connected csv to tableau public and made a dashboard out of it.
5. Finally, Combined all the files and documented in github repo.
